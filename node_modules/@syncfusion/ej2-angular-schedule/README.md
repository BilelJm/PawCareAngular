## Setup

### Create an Angular Application

You can use [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to setup your Angular applications. To install the Angular CLI, use the following command.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Create a new Angular application using the following Angular CLI command.

```bash
ng new my-app
cd my-app
```

### Adding Syncfusion Schedule package

All Syncfusion Angular packages are available in [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/~syncfusionorg). To install the Angular schedule package, use the following command.

```bash
ng add @syncfusion/ej2-angular-schedule
```

The above command does the below configuration to your Angular app.
 
 * Adds `@syncfusion/ej2-angular-schedule` package and its peer dependencies to your `package.json` file.
 * Imports the `ScheduleModule` in your application module `app.module.ts`.
 * Registers the Syncfusion UI default theme (material) in the `angular.json` file.

This makes it easy to add the Syncfusion Angular Schedule module to your project and start using it in your application.

### Module injection

In the **app.component.ts** file, use the following code to inject the modules.

```typescript
@Component({
  providers: [DayService, WeekService, WorkWeekService, MonthService, AgendaService, MonthAgendaService, TimelineViewsService, TimelineMonthService]
})
```

### Add Schedule component

In **src/app/app.component.ts**, use `<ejs-schedule>` selector in the `template` attribute of the `@Component` directive to render the Syncfusion Angular Schedule component.

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { EventSettingsModel, DayService, WeekService, WorkWeekService, MonthService, AgendaService } from '@syncfusion/ej2-angular-schedule';
@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    providers: [DayService, WeekService, WorkWeekService, MonthService, AgendaService],
    template: `<ejs-schedule [selectedDate]='selectedDate'
  [eventSettings]='eventSettings'></ejs-schedule>`
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  public data: object[] = [
    {
      Id: 1,
      Subject: 'Meeting',
      StartTime: new Date(2023, 1, 15, 10, 0),
      EndTime: new Date(2023, 1, 15, 12, 30)
    },
  ];
  public selectedDate: Date = new Date(2023 1, 15);
  public eventSettings: EventSettingsModel = {
    dataSource: this.data
  };
}
```
